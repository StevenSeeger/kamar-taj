A place where we asynchronously work through technical books and projects, trying to increase our technical skills and understanding of behind the scenes mathematics.

## Organization of the Repo

* Main
    * Books Working On/Working On
        * ~~Master~~ Book Example Code (if available)
            * By chapter
        * ~~Sourcerers~~ User Code and Notes
            * By chapter
    * Books that there are interest in
        * Preferably split up by skill
            * Markdown file (need template file for this)
                * Link to an indepth description of the book
                * Your brief description of the book
                * Probably some way to indicate how many people/who is interested in the book
    * Users
        * Markdown file
            * Your Ranking/Role
            * Which books you have worked through
            * Things you are interested in learning

## Masters of the Mystic Arts' Main Goal

Anyone that joins is free to work on any book in the books working on/worked on. The purpose of this is to allow for asynchronous techincal skill work. You can do your code in whatever langauge you want (R, Ruby, Python, Julia, Stan, C, C++, Raw Stan, Assembly, Machine Language, etc.) As you work your way through chapters of any given book, whenever you push your code, somebody that has also worked through the chapter (this does not mean that they need to have their code merged and approved, just that they also worked through the material and understand it) should review your code and your notes and leave comments on your work, and then should either approve it for you to merge, or if there are issues, create issues.

Please remember to respectful when leaving feedback. We are all here to learn. And remember to ask questions! If you worked through your code in R, and somebody else did their work in Python or Ruby, ask questions about what is going on! Knowing how other langauges work and understanding how to simply is instrumental in truly gaining a full understanding of the behind the scene mathematics and solutions going on, as well as how different programing lanaguges work.

## Rankings/Roles

Thinking about having rankings/roles defined as followed:

### Known Rankings/Roles

1. The Board
    * Currently Unknown; This group of entities grant new knowledge and power to Sourcer Supreme. Intentions are also unknown, please use discretion when gaining new knowledge and power from this source
2. Sorcerer Supreme
    * Goes through books at a good pace. Leaves good feedback, answers questions, has straightforward notes and code
3. Disciple
    * Goes through books at a good pace. Leaves feedback on others at a semi consistent pace and answers questions (but much less frequently than the Sorcerer Supreme). Notes and Code leaves something to be desired (ie its a bit unclear, or is only understandable by a few)
4. Apprentice
    * Goes through books at a neutral pace. Leaves feedback on others at a minimal pace and answers questions (but much less frequently than the Sorcerer Supreme). Notes and Code leaves a lot to be desired (ie its a rather unclear, or is only understandable by the person who wrote it)
5. Novice
    * Goes through the books at a bare minimum pace. Leaves feedback on others at a minimal pace and answers questions (but much less frequently than the Sorcerer Supreme). Notes and Code leaves a lot to be desired (ie its a rather unclear, or is only understandable by the person who wrote it)

### Unknown Ranking/Roles

* Thanos
* Dormammu
* Zealots
